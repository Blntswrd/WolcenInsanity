# WolcenInsanity

A Mod for the Game "Wolcen", which aims to increase the level caps and item drop values, towards insanity. Currently supporting itemdrops until level 9999, proper mobs and affixes to come. Currently only a few select levels are usable from the menu, this should change in the future. Same with the item affixes, those have no progression yet and are totally unbalanced. Items from level 190 and 1337 can drop the same values, high rolls are mostly only the original value times ten.


## How to install? 

The files shall be copied into the "Wolcen\Game", so that you for example have the folder "Wolcen\Game\Umbra".
Those folders are the unpacked and modified equivalent of the respective .pak file. The folders will be read with priority when playing offline. This way the mods will not be overwritten when the game updates.

If this does not work, create, for every folder under "Game" a .zip file and rename it .pak, replacing the original one. (Don't forget the backup, also this way you should never attempt to go online and with every update the mod will be overwritten.)

Feel free to contribute and modify :D
