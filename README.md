# WolcenInsanity

A Mod for the Game "Wolcen", which aims to increase the level caps and item drop values, towards insanity. Currently supporting itemdrops until level 9999, proper mobs and affixes to come. Currently only a few select levels are usable from the menu, this should change in the future. Same with the item affixes, those have no progression yet and are totally unbalanced. Items from level 190 and 1337 can drop the same values, high rolls are mostly only the original value times ten.

Feel free to contribute and modify :D
